# LocalGov Drupal Repos

This is a simple repo to create [a GitHub pages site](https://localgovdrupal.github.io/localgov_repos/) to list all of our repos.

We can then search them much faster than GitHub search does.

Within the list of each repo we have useful information such as how many open issues it has, how many open PRs, quick links to get to these pages, etc.

If you have any ideas for more info in these cards, please create an issue in this repo.

Current maintainer: Mark Conroy.
